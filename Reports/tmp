1. neural networks
learn it
see what we got
we don't need to think a lot about nature of our features
but we don't know about learning of our neural network
very difficult to teach
2. analysis of some easier algorithms
from audio try to make classification by unknown types (e. g. phonems)
from fonems we can try clasterize by groups
gauss mixture models
i. e. from our place to decide what to do with our landmark

NEXT
from lip image we need to know what we speak
16 KHz (16 numbers per second)
main sounds, make small pieces (10-50 miliseconds)
remember what they mean
clasterize (phonems)
give sound (not very good)
but if quiet long, sound will be quiet good
